<span class="largetitle">Behavior of Asian carp larvae</span>

<br /><br />

<img border="0" src="images/16-behavior-of-asian-carp-larvae-16.jpg" width="420" height="320" style="float: right; margin: 15px;padding:10px; border: 1px #ECECEC solid;" alt="Behavior of Asian carp larvae. ">


<div class="strong2">Background/Problem</div><br />

<p>Prior to this work, very little was known about the behavior of Asian carp larvae, and most of what was previously believed has been disproven.  The eggs of Asian carps drift in the current and if they settle to the bottom they are believed to perish.  The length of river required for Asian carp reproduction can be determined using this required drift period.  It was believed that the larvae would also be subject to this requirement until they reached a developmental stage capable of swimming.  Additionally, Asian carp larvae are known to appear in wetland nursery environments but it was unclear if the fish were washed there or if they arrived through their own locomotive abilities.  Knowledge of where and how Asian carp larvae arrive in nursery areas is required to focus efforts on destruction of the larvae and juveniles.  Furthermore, knowledge of depth selection and swimming speed are needed to enhance early detection efforts based on egg and larvae detection.</p>





<div style="border-bottom:solid #ECECEC 1px;"></div><br />

<div class="strong2">Description of Work</div><br />

<p>Bighead, silver and grass carp larvae were raised in the laboratory.  Larvae were observed during the hatching process. Recently hatched larvae were placed in 10 feet tall clear vertical containers where the carp were exposed to light for a similar amount of time during the day as they would experience in a river during the spawning period.  Depth selection, swimming behavior, and swimming speed were observed in both day and night periods.</p>


<div style="border-bottom:solid #ECECEC 1px;"></div><br />


<div class="strong2">Relevance/Benefits</div><br />

<p>Understanding the stage at which Asian carps begin swimming is critical to development of models that predict whether a river is adequate for reproduction by Asian carps.  Knowledge of where and how Asian carp larvae arrive in nursery areas is required to focus efforts on destruction of the larvae and juveniles.  Furthermore, knowledge of depth selection and swimming speed are needed to enhance early detection efforts based on egg and larvae detection.</p>

<div class="strong2">Key Findings</div><br />

<ul class="newList">
	<li style="margin-left:10px;">Bighead and silver carps swam vigorously immediately after hatching, but only vertically.  Fish swam vigorously almost straight upwards</li>
	<li style="margin-left:10px;">Horizontal swimming began at a developmental stage coinciding with the development of the gas bladder.  At gas bladder inflation, they were capable of holding their position in the water without swimming or vigorous directional swimming.  </li>
	<li style="margin-left:10px;">Gas bladder emergence also corresponds to the youngest life stages appearing in off-channel nursery environments, in another USGS study.  This indicates that carps choose to move toward nursery habitats, and provides information necessary to deploy control efforts directed at larvae and juvenile carps.</li>
	<li style="margin-left:10px;">Prior to gas bladder inflation, larvae used the entire water column for their upward swimming then sinking behavior.  After gas bladder inflation, larvae concentrated near the surface in daylight periods, but spread through the water column at night.  This is an indication that surface plankton tows in the daylight period would be most successful for early detection of young Asian carp in nursery habitats.</li>
</ul>
