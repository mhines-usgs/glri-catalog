<div class="strong2">Background/Problem</div><br />

<p>Geospatial information is the cornerstone of effective restoration and 
ecosystem management at the regional level. Of the Great Lakes, the Lake Erie 
watershed is the closest to achieving complete LiDAR coverage of the watershed. 
One particular opportunity within the Lake Erie watershed is the Huron-Erie 
Corridor (HEC), which includes the St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair, and the 
Detroit River, is a major multi-use waterway, involving commercial shipping, 
recreational boating, the international wildlife refuge, and intakes for the 
Detroit Water and Sewer Department, which provides drinking water to almost 5 
million people in Detroit and surrounding communities. The HEC is also the site 
of major industrial development (chemical plants near Sarnia, Rouge Plant, Zug 
Island), 5 Areas of Concern, and rapid land use and land cover change. In 
addition to the ecological concerns, the HEC is also an international border, 
the site of significant smuggling activities, and home to the Fermi nuclear 
plant.</p>

<p>
Currently no high resolution elevation data exists for the majority of this 
region, including the entirety of St. Clair, Macomb, and Monroe Counties, 
Michigan. Completing coverage of these counties will assist in developing a 
masterplan for the St. Clair River and Lake St. Clair, as well as provide much 
better understanding of watershed processes conveying point- and non-point 
source materials to the HEC.</p>
<p>
Beyond the HEC, several upland counties in Michigan and Indiana also need to be 
completed to make basin-wide analyses feasible.</p>
<p>
This project will support multiple Federal, State, and local data needs for 
ecology, restoration, planning, and public safety.</p>


<div style="border-bottom:solid #ECECEC 1px;">&nbsp;</div><br />

<div class="strong2">Objectives/Scope</div><br />

<p>Complete LiDAR coverage for the Huron-Erie Corridor. Depending on funds 
actually available or obtained through partnerships, expand to finish the Lake 
Erie watershed. Make all of this data available to scientists, managers, 
State/County/Local agencies, and the general public.</p>

<div style="border-bottom:solid #ECECEC 1px;">&nbsp;</div><br />

<div class="strong2">Relevance/Benefits/Federal Role</div><br />

<p>LiDAR is a critical data need for many Federal, State, and local agencies, as 
well as environmental managers and researchers. Much of the elevation data in 
the Great Lakes, and within the western Lake Erie watershed, is more than 30 
years old. In regions of modest relief, such as the lake plains of Monroe and 
Macomb County, MI, the existing 30m DEM and 10ft contours are both outdated and 
lack sufficient detail to identify areas of current or potential wetlands, 
develop restoration and management plans, or even delineate watersheds reliably. 
Further, the additional derivative products of the LiDAR, including land cover, 
canopy height, and biomass, among others, provide useful information for 
restoration.</p>
<p>Large, consolidated purchases through established contract vehicles minimizes 
the data cost per unit area, while assuring a high level of standardization and 
compatibility. The USGS has been a leader in this field for two decades, and has 
ongoing relationships with partners flying areas ranging in size from individual 
counties to the state of Iowa.</p>

<div style="border-bottom:solid #ECECEC 1px;">&nbsp;</div><br />

<div class="strong2">Approach</div><br />

<p>Working with county governments, the State of Michigan, and other Federal 
Agencies, particularly the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Geological Survey will 
endeavor to acquire high-resolution elevation and LiDAR point-cloud data for (in 
order of priority): Macomb County, St. Clair County, and Monroe County, 
Michigan. Data will be acquired based on a standard USGS specification requiring 
2 meter maximum sample spacing, 15cm maximum vertical error, as well as several 
interpreted products (full specification attached).</p>
<p>The contract will be handled by the USGS National Geospatial Technical 
Operations Center (NGTOC) Commercial Partnerships Team (CPT) based in Rolla 
Missouri. The NGTOC will be reimbursed at a rate of between 5 and 10% for labor 
associated with contract management, administration, and QA/QC of the products.</p>
<p>The rapidly deteriorating budget situation for local governments in Southeast 
Michigan has called into question the availability of local matching funds. In 
the absence of local matching funds, data sharing agreements will be negotiated 
with the counties to make locally maintained geospatial data available to 
scientists and the general public. Priority will be given first to HEC counties, 
then counties contributing to the HEC, and finally other counties in the Lake 
Erie Basin that have not been flown.</p>
<p><b>Highest priority:</b> Macomb1,2, St. Clair2, Monroe Counties2, MI<br>
<b>Second Priority:</b> Sanilac, Lapeer, Livingston2, Lenawee, and Hillsdale 
Counties, MI<br>
<b>Third Priority:</b> Adams, Allen, DeKalb, Wells, and Steuben, IN</p>
<p><b>1 - </b>Macomb County has committed matching funds toward developing an 
improved product.<br>
<b>2 - </b>The SEMCOG Counties may acquire LiDAR as part of the ARRA Geospatial 
Stimulus program. If so, this will allow better coverage of the 2nd and 3rd 
priority areas.</p>


<div style="border-bottom:solid #ECECEC 1px;"></div><br />

<div class="strong2">Products/Communications</div><br />

<p>In terms of planning and managing the project, communications will be 
primarily between USGS Liaisons and county partners, or Federal partners.</p>
<p>The Federal collaborators on the 2011 remote sensing plan have developed a 
white paper for GLNPO. This white paper has been provided for review and 
comment, and will likely be revised to address concerns or comments GLNPO may 
have. The intent of that document is explain both the GLNPO and to watchdog 
groups the different remote sensing technologies being employed in several 
templates, and express how these various efforts complement each other, rather 
than compete.</p>
<p>A fact sheet will be developed in conjunction with the EROS Data Center based 
on data for Wayne Co, MI (about to be delivered 12/2009) illustrating the 
improvements possible in watershed delineation, hydrologic routing, and land 
cover classification based on LiDAR, as well as examples of several additional 
analyses, such as cut-fill, canopy closure, and biomass estimates.</p>
<p>Following production of the data, in conjunction with partnering local and 
regional agencies, we can do a press release and a demonstration of identifying 
a wetland based on the LiDAR and imagery (from a separate funding source) we 
will be partnering on in the Detroit area. The biggest opportunity may not be 
until 2011, when new topographic maps will be produced with the new data.</p>
