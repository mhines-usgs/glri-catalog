<div class="strong_updated">Update</div><br />

<p class="updated">1.) Through a cooperative effort with Michigan Tech Research 
Institute (MTRI), a spatial analyst lab, we used satellite data (PALSAR) to 
create a basin-wide map of <i>Phragmites</i> in the Great Lakes. The mapping 
effort also was supported by GLRI funds from the USFWS. The basin-wide map of 
the US coastal zone shows variability in the distribution of <i>Phragmites</i>, 
with certain regions (e.g., western Lake Erie, southern Lake Huron, Green Bay of 
Lake Michigan) supporting extensive <i>Phragmites</i>. This mapping product 
represents mature invasive <i>Phragmites</i> stands that are 0.2 ha or larger. 
Map accuracy was determined using an extensive network of field validation 
points. The type of data and analysis methods used do not easily map the native
<i>Phragmites</i> or sparse stands at the expansion front.</p>
<p class="updated">2.) Many climate models for the Great Lakes predict lower 
lake levels, which can expose fertile wetland bottomlands to invasive species 
such as <i>Phragmites</i>. Using LIDAR data that were collected as part of a 
NOAA GLRI project, we determined what bottomlands may be exposed under reduced 
lake-level scenarios and become potential corridors for <i>Phragmites</i> 
invasion. We performed a simple vulnerability analysis related to proximity to 
current <i>Phragmites</i> stands to assist managers with early detection and 
control.</p></p>

<p class="updated">3.) We have preliminary results from a more rigorous 
vulnerability analysis that involves compiling large-scale, GIS-based 
environmental drivers for the Great Lakes basin and relating them to current <i>
Phragmites</i> distribution. This represents a new frontier in large-scale <i>
Phragmites</i> ecology that has never before been performed. Preliminary results 
indicate that three primary variables (i.e., nitrogen concentration, proximity 
to agriculture, and population density) are associated with extensive invasive
<i>Phragmites</i> stands. Using species distribution modeling, we are using key 
environmental variables and data on the mapped <i>Phragmites</i> to create a 
spatial habitat suitability index that indicates areas that are highly 
vulnerable to <i>Phragmites</i> invasion. This vulnerability map can be used by 
managers for early detection, monitoring, and control, especially in areas being 
restored under the GLRI.</p>
<p class="updated">4.) Scientists from the USGS Great Lakes Science Center 
worked with staff at the USGS Center for Integrated Data Analytics to make the 
mapping data available to the public using the GLRI GeoNetwork. The GeoNetwork 
is primarily a metadata catalog that describes the availability and structure of 
geospatial data sets produced by GLRI projects but also supports the graphical 
interpretation of these products through interactive maps that allow users to 
view and print depictions of available data at custom scales (<a href="https://cida.usgs.gov/glri/geonetwork/srv/en/main.home">https://cida.usgs.gov/glri/geonetwork/srv/en/main.home</a>). 
An online decision support tool is being developed to allow users to access the 
mapping and modeling data produced in this study.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<div class="strong2">Background/Problem</div><br />

<p>Current climate-change models predict significantly lower water levels in the 
Great Lakes that would expose large areas of fertile bottomlands to invasion by 
non-native <i>Phragmites</i> <i>australis</i> (henceforth <i>Phragmites</i>) and other aggressive 
plant species (Croley 1990, Smith 1991, Magnuson et al. 1997, Lofgren et al. 
2002, Kling et al. 2003). By altering ecological processes, changes in 
climatological, hydrologic, and nutrient-loading patterns could increase the 
spread of non-native <i>Phragmites</i> into existing Great Lakes coastal and diked 
wetlands (Galatowitsch et al. 1999). These aggressive invasive plants can 
drastically reduce habitat diversity and function (Chambers et al. 1999), 
thereby affecting a multi-billion-dollar regional fishery and other dependent 
wildlife.</p>

<p><i>Phragmites</i> forms impenetrable stands with thick detritus that help it to 
outcompete native flora and quickly degrade the functions and values of large 
areas of highly productive coastal wetlands (Minchinton et al. 2006). 
Established stands often reach heights in excess of 4 m and impair the human use 
of beaches and recreational areas. Invasion success of <i>Phragmites</i> has been 
related primarily to hydrologic alteration (Welch et al. 2006) as well as 
shoreline development and nitrogen pollution (King et al. 2007).</p>
<p>The cost to control established <i>Phragmites</i> stands is enormous and often 
overwhelming, necessitating improved strategies for limiting spread and 
identifying the need for treatment early. Unfortunately, public and private 
resource managers lack detailed maps of both existing <i>Phragmites</i> colonies and 
areas vulnerable to <i>Phragmites</i> invasion under current or predicted water levels. 
Therefore, a thorough assessment of the species’ distribution throughout the 
U.S. Great Lakes shoreline (Fig. 1), as well as the prediction of pathways of 
spread during climate change, will enable managers to target and prioritize 
control efforts.</p>


<div style="border-bottom:solid #ECECEC 1px;"></div><br />

<div class="strong2">Objectives/Scope</div><br />

<p><b>Goals: </b>
</p>

<ul id="list-normal">
<li>Identify current <i>Phragmites</i> distribution in the Great Lakes coastal zone,</li>
<li>detect potential areas vulnerable to invasion due to influences such as 
altered water levels, nutrient and sediment loading, and shoreline development, 
and</li>
<li>communicate project results to researchers, managers, policy makers, and the 
general public to guide future management and restoration efforts throughout the 
Great Lakes basin.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Objectives:</b></p>

<ul id="list-normal">
<li>Use remote sensing to map the current extent of <i>Phragmites</i> in the 
Great Lakes coastal zone,</li>
<li>assess areas vulnerable to the spread of <i>Phragmites</i> under predicted 
climate-change scenarios and environmental influences (e.g., nutrients, 
hydrology, shoreline development), and</li>
<li>give presentations, write a USGS fact sheet, create a web-based 
decision-support tool, and begin work toward communicating project results to 
the public and decision makers verbally and in journal publications.</li>
</ul>

<div style="border-bottom:solid #ECECEC 1px;"></div><br />

<div class="strong2">Relevance/Benefits/Federal Role</div><br />

<p>The basin-wide map of current <i>Phragmites</i> distribution that will be 
produced will be useful to natural resource managers and will provide a basis 
for basin-wide efforts to control <i>Phragmites</i>, especially in areas where 
preservation of native biodiversity is particularly important. As nothing like 
this currently exists, such a map will prove invaluable for controlling the 
spread of this invasive species. Wetlands with previously undiscovered stands of
<i>Phragmites</i> will be identified, and restoration efforts can be directed at 
these areas. Predicting corridors for future invasion by assessing vulnerability 
of exposed bottomlands to expansion will allow managers to target and prioritize 
control efforts, especially in relation to current coastal wetland restoration 
efforts.</p>

<p>This project addresses mission, vision, and multiple priorities identified in 
the USGS Strategic Plan and the USGS – Great Lakes Science Center Strategic 
Plan. It is consistent with the U.S. Climate Change Science Program strategic 
goals, the research goals of multiple programs within USGS (i.e., Ecosystems, 
Invasive Species, Fisheries: Aquatic and Endangered Resources), and initiatives 
endorsed by the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration. The USGS – Great Lakes 
Science Center (USGS – GLSC) has the mission, staff, facilities, and equipment 
to lead the cutting-edge research involved in this basin-wide effort. </p>

<div style="border-bottom:solid #ECECEC 1px;"></div><br />

<div class="strong2">Approach</div><br />

<p><b><i>Phragmites</i> Mapping</b> – A map of the current <i>Phragmites</i> 
distribution along the U.S. Great Lakes coastal zone (10-km buffer inland from 
shore) will be generated and published as a web-based decision-support tool.</p>

<ul id="list-normal">
<li>Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF) will procure the 260 multi-temporal radar 
imagery scenes (dual-polarized ALOS PALSAR) necessary to map the U.S. Great 
Lakes shoreline and will georegister the scenes to within 1-2 pixels.</li>
<li>Using the georectified scenes, Michigan Tech Research Institute (MTRI) will 
map current extent of <i>Phragmites</i> by basin using algorithms developed and 
tested for this purpose.</li>
<li>Ground-truthing of the mapping effort will be performed by MTRI. Field crews 
will collect pre-selected GPS points and digital photos of <i>Phragmites</i> and 
other vegetation and will transmit these data to MTRI image analysts through a 
Google Earth field tracking system.</li>
<li>Preliminary maps of each basin will be distributed via a web-based tool 
supported by USGS Center for Integrated Data Analytics (CIDA) under a separate 
GLRI project. Validation by MTRI of maps to 95% confidence using ground-truth 
data will begin in FY10 and will be finalized in FY11.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Vulnerability Assessment (Predicting Corridors of Expansion)</b> - To 
understand the large-scale factors influencing <i>Phragmites</i> distribution, 
GIS analyses and statistical methods will be used to relate current <i>
Phragmites</i> extent to variables such as, but not limited to, slope and 
topography, nutrient loading to the coastal zone, proximity to urban and 
agricultural land-use types, shoreline development, and water depth. The major 
influencing factors will be used to develop a GIS modeling framework to identify 
areas vulnerable to invasion. Using these FY10 results, FY11 efforts will 
advance prediction of <i>Phragmites</i> expansion in the coastal zone given the 
water-level scenarios of current climate-change models.</p>

<ul id="list-normal">
<li>USGS -GLSC will obtain LIDAR non-bare earth topographic and bathymetric data 
as 1-m DEMs from NOAA Coastal Services Center and USACE Joint Airborne Lidar 
Bathymetry Technical Center of Expertise (JALBTCX). Other bathymetric data 
sources will be researched and acquired, if available, for the shoreline extent 
from Cleveland, OH to Port Huron, MI, where turbidity precluded collection of 
LIDAR data.</li>
<li>The bathymetric data will be converted to slopes and water-depth contours 
for a 0.5 m, 1.0 m, and 1.5 m drop in water level or other relevant water-level 
scenarios determined by downscaled climate models. LIDAR data also will be 
analyzed for geomorphic obstructions (e.g., bluffs) to <i>Phragmites</i> 
expansion. Substrate data will be requested from USACE. A GIS data layer of land 
use will be generated from the publicly available MIRIS data set. Tributary 
nutrient-load data and nutrient data from the SPAtially Referenced Regressions 
On Watershed attributes (SPARROW) model will be acquired from USGS CIDA and the 
USGS Wisconsin Water Science Center, respectively. Water-level data will be 
obtained from the NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory website and 
converted to depth using the LIDAR bathymetric data.</li>
<li>General linear modeling and regression analysis will be used to determine 
significant relationships, if any, between current <i>Phragmites</i> occurrence 
and the above environmental variables (slope, topography, nutrient and sediment 
loading, land use, shoreline development, water depth, water-level fluctuation).</li>
<li>To identify areas vulnerable to invasion, we first will map potential 
wetland area for four water-level scenarios predicted by downscaled climate 
models or predetermined (i.e., current 2009 levels and a 0.5 m, 1.0 m, and 1.5 m 
drop in water level). The following two criteria will be used to identify 
potential wetland area: 1) being at an elevation where mean high water level is 
between 0.1 m and 2 m and 2) having a substrate other than bedrock. Vulnerable 
areas will be identified as regions within the potential wetland area with a 
slope appropriate for <i>Phragmites</i> growth (as identified in #3 above) and 
with a topographic corridor linking it to the current <i>Phragmites</i> 
population. Highly vulnerable areas will be identified where nutrients, 
shoreline development, or other significant variables suggest greater 
probability for <i>Phragmites</i> expansion.</li>
<li>The vulnerability maps for each of the water-level scenarios will be 
published alongside the <i>Phragmites</i> map in the web-based tool. Users will 
be able to overlay water-level contours for each of the scenarios as well as 
sites identified as biodiversity protection areas by The Nature Conservancy and 
other organizations.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Plans for FY11</b></p>

<p>In FY11, we hope to finalize the validation of the FY10 mapping product and 
continue enhancing our understanding of <i>Phragmites</i> expansion through 1) 
predictive species distribution modeling and 2) historic photo-interpretation to 
describe mechanisms of spatial expansion by <i>Phragmites</i>. Going beyond 
assessing vulnerability of wetland area, these efforts will allow us to predict 
with greater certainty where <i>Phragmites</i> will expand. The modeling 
framework could be extended to describe invasion by other species of interest as 
well (e.g., Lythrum salicaria, purple loosestrife; Hydrocharis morsus-ranae, 
frogbit, Typha angustifolia and Typha x glauca; cattail).</p>

<li>Final <i>Phragmites</i> maps were made available to the general public and 
land managers through the USGS Center for Integrated Data Analytics (CIDA) GLRI 
GeoNetwork. The GeoNetwork is primarily a metadata catalog that describes the 
availability and structure of geospatial data sets produced by GLRI efforts but 
also allows the graphical interpretation of these products through interactive 
maps. (https://cida.usgs.gov/glri/geonetwork/srv/en/main.home). Other 
project-related data publicly available on the existing GeoNetwork include a 
study area extent, raw lidar topo-bathymetry, the proximity-weighted reduced 
lake-level scenarios that were derived from LIDAR, a layer showing users where 
LIDAR data were unavailable, a separate set of reduced lake-level scenarios made 
possible by NOAA 1-m bathymetric contours, and a variety of base layers.</li>
<li>The GLRI&nbsp;<i>Phragmites</i>&nbsp;Decision Support Tool (DST) Mapper 
(<a href="http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/phragmites/">http://cida.usgs.gov/glri/phragmites/</a>) is intended to 
provide resource managers with information to strategically develop effective&nbsp;<i>Phragmites</i>&nbsp;control 
and invasion prevention programs in the Great Lakes coastal zone (10 km inland 
from the shoreline). The Mapper consists of three integrated components:

<ul id="list-normal">
<li>A distribution map of large (&gt; 0.2 ha) stands of existing&nbsp;<i>Phragmites</i>.</li>
<li>A map of estimated&nbsp;<i>Phragmites</i>&nbsp;habitat suitability based on current 
environmental conditions.</li>
<li>Corridor networks including reduced lake-level scenarios that are weighted 
by proximity to existing&nbsp;<i>Phragmites</i>&nbsp;to show likely invasion pathways.</li>
