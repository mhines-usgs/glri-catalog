# To use, remove the '#' header and rename this file tag_mappings.csv
#
# This file is used to update tags in records.  Running the Update Tags JMeter Node w/ a config file here
# WILL MATCH ONLY A SINGLE TAG PER PROJECT.  So, only sets of mutually exclusive tags can be put in this
# file at a single time.  Once it finds a match, it will make the update for that tag and move on to the
# next project.

# Key
# old_scheme is used to match existing tags in a record for possible update (case insensitive)
# old_value can be '*' to match any value and copy it thru to the updated tag.  Or, can match a specific value (case insensitive)
# old_type ignored / not used (but the tab to delimit it must at least be present).  It is not used to match.
# new_scheme If a tag is matched, the scheme is replaced with the new_scheme
# new_value If a tag is matched, the 'name' is replaced with the new_value.  If the old_value is specified as '*', the new_value is ignored and the original 'name' is kept.
# new_type If a tag is matched, the new_type will replace the tags type.  Typically these are all 'Label'.
#
# Below is an example of updating a scheme, but only for certain values.  Here is is assumed that the two possible values for this tag
# are mutually exclusive, so they can be run in one go in one config file.  If they were not, they would have to be place in separate
# files and run separately because processing on a project will stop once a match is found.
